## What is wealth creation?

zWealth creation is investing in different asset classes where the investments will help fulfil critical needs. These investments should also be self-contained,  stable, income-generating, and help one achieve their aspirations.

The wealth creation process will be most effective if started early. Starting investments during the early stages of life will give a head start on achieving goals. It also helps in generating higher growth in the long term. This is due to the power of compounding. The power of compounding is a concept that will help build a considerable future corpus. The idea of compounding revolves around reinvesting the returns into the fund to earn higher growth. Therefore, the longer one stays invested, the higher the wealth gain.

1. It provides you with money to fulfil your future goals.
