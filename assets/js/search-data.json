            "title": "What is an NFT?",
            "content": "Background . Jack Dorsey sells his first tweet ever as an NFT for $2.9 million, read the headline of major business newspapers on 24th March 2021. A year later, Twitter is going private, all thanks to Elon Musk, in what is said to be the largest Leveraged buyout (LBO) ever. Both Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk are successful entrepreneurs who have voiced their support for the Blockchain Revolution. This revolution is not going away anytime soon! Let’s get back to the question, can you sell a tweet? How do you do it, and what is that N-F-T doing there in the headline? . What is an NFT? . NFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token; non-fungible means something that cannot be exchanged for an item because it is unique. In other words, you can exchange a ₹100 note for another ₹100 note as both have the same value associated with them. Another classic example is a cryptocurrency; 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another. Cryptocurrency is fungible, whereas NFTs are not. On the other hand, one piece of artwork is not equal to another; The Mona Lisa is not equal to a Van Gogh’s since both have unique properties. NFTs are tokens that live on a blockchain and represent ownership of unique items. Why do you need a blockchain to do this? Well, tracking a digital file is tricky, as it can be copied and distributed effortlessly. A blockchain comes in handy for ease of tracking ownership and for the value discovery of an asset. Let us take an example to cement our understanding. . Suppose you made a piece of digital art. You can create a .jpg or mint an NFT out of this. The NFT that represents your art contains information about it, such as . A unique fingerprint ID of the file (Hash) . | Token Name . | Token Symbol . | . This token is then stored on the blockchain, and you, the artist, become the owner. To sell the artwork, you create a transaction on the blockchain, and the blockchain makes sure that this information can never be tampered with. It also allows you to track the current owner if the artwork is traded further. In other words, it is a smart contract on the blockchain that stores the unique properties of the asset and keeps track of current and previous owners. . Specifics of an NFT . It is important to note that the artwork itself is not stored in the blockchain; only its attributes like hash, name and a link to the actual artwork are stored in the block. Also, one must keep in mind that you often do not get a physical copy of the original artwork and most of the time, anyone can download a physical copy for free. The NFT only represents proof of ownership. It gives you exclusive ‘digital bragging rights. . NFTs are not limited to pieces of digital artwork, though a bulk of the market comprises these; NFTs can also include concert tickets, domain names, in-game limited edition items, real estate and anything that is unique and requires proof of ownership. The prices of NFTs are not uniform and depend on supply-demand characteristics. A word of caution: an expensive NFT becomes worthless if no one wants to buy it! . . FAQs . Where can one buy NFTs? . NFTs can be bought online on open-source exchanges and NFT marketplaces. . Which blockchain is used in NFTs? . A bulk of contracts are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. .",

            "title": "ULIPs",
            "content": "Introduction . In today’s fast-paced world, financial planning is paramount. An individual is expected to know about investment and insurance. These financial products serve different purposes- Investing is related to wealth creation, whereas Insurance is financial protection. An individual must strike a balance between the two to have sound financial planning. Unit-linked insurance plans are a widely acclaimed investment cum insurance instrument globally. Unit-linked insurance plans, or ULIPs, as they are generally called, are integrated financial products that have features of both insurance and investment. . What is ULIP? . ULIP stands for Unit Linked Insurance Plan. This is an insurance product that offers investors exposure to capital markets. You can gain market-linked returns by investing in equity/ debt/ hybrid funds. With ULIPs, you can create wealth to achieve your life goals while the smiles of your loved ones stay protected. . How does ULIP Work? . Working on a Unit-Linked Insurance Plan is pretty simple. The insurer invests a part of the premium you have paid in shares or bonds, and the rest is invested in providing life cover. Once you pay the premium, several more investors invest in the same portfolio. The insurer further pools this money and, after deducting the expenses, invests in the fund chosen by you. It could be either equity, balanced or debt funds. The total sum of money is further divided into units. The insurance company allocates these units to each investor according to the amount invested. This unit value is called NAV or Net Asset Value. The units’ NAV either increase or decrease based on the market value. On maturity of the plan, the insurer pays the fund value to the investors depending upon the market value. In case of your untimely death, the insurer pays your beneficiary higher than the fund value or available fund value. ULIPs also allow you to switch between equities and debt and vice-versa if you wish to do so. If equity markets are not doing well, you can switch to debt to preserve your gains. On the other hand, you can move from debt to equity if you have a high-risk tolerance. This flexibility has made ULIP policies highly popular. . These instruments also have a five year lock-in period where the investor cannot withdraw their units. If you start prematurely, the death cover is ceased immediately, and you are paid the balance amount only after three years. . Types of ULIPs . ULIPs for long-term wealth creation: . Regular and Single Premium ULIP: In a standard premium ULIP, you need to pay dividends over some time. On the other hand, in a single premium ULIP, you pay the entire premium. You can choose the one as per your income and cash flow. Life staged based and Non-life stage based ULIP: Needs at different stages of life are different, isn’t it? Life stage based ULIPs invest your money accordingly. For example, when you are young and single, you may have a higher risk appetite, and, therefore, a higher allocation is towards equities. As you grow old, the equity allocation reduces. The strategy ensures asset allocation matches your age and financial requirements. However, this is not the case with a non-life stage-based plan. You choose the funds as per your risk appetite and can switch between them when desired. Guaranteed and Non-Guaranteed ULIP: Capital protection is the objective of guaranteed ULIP. It has limited equity exposure. On the other hand, a non-guaranteed ULIP offers you a range of funds as per your risk tolerance and financial goals. In these ULIPs, you can opt for a high equity . ULIPs to secure your child’s future (Goal Based): . As a parent, you want to give the best of everything to your child. It’s your responsibility to secure your child’s future and ensure their needs are met even in your absence. ULIPs for a child can help you in your efforts and ensures your child’s needs are well-taken care of even when you are no longer around. These ULIPs help you save and build a large corpus for your child’s higher education, and in case of an unfortunate event, the insurer pays a fixed lump sum that helps your family meet immediate requirements. Also, some plans offer the facility to partially withdraw to fund essential education milestones of your child’s life. . ULIPs for retirement: . Everyone dreams of a stress-free retirement. ULIPs for retirement help you save and invest in a disciplined manner to build a large retirement corpus that enables you to take care of your post-retirement needs with ease. While the purpose of the ULIP mentioned above plans may differ, they help you in disciplined savings and investments to achieve your set goal. . Why buy ULIPs? . Flexible: ULIPs offer investors the option of switching between funds, resulting in better choices for the investor. Investors can choose to invest in either debt or equity funds depending on their risk appetite and market conditions. Risk appetite: ULIPs offer investors to choose their investments based on their risk appetite. Low-risk appetite investors can choose to invest in debt funds, and those willing to take a higher risk can opt for equity funds. Low charges: ULIPs do not have high costs associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual fee on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial ten years, with the charges on par with mutual funds. Long term investment: ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period, which also reap more significant returns. Disciplined Investing: ULIP plans function with periodic regular investments in the form of premiums. This discipline of traditional investment takes you closer to the mission of wealth creation and achieving the financial goals at the right time. . Tax Benefits . Premium paid on ULIPs is eligible for a deduction under Section 80C up to a maximum of ₹ 1.5 lakhs during a year. Further, the amount you receive on maturity is tax-exempt under Section 10(10D). . . FAQs . When were ULIPs introduced in India? . ULIPs were first introduced in India by the Unit Trust of India (UTI) in 1971. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), then, introduced more ULIP products in 1989. . Which organisations issue ULIP? . Generally, public and private sector insurance providers, which either operate solo or have partnered with foreign insurance companies, offer ULIP products to their customers. Offering ULIP products requires the approval of both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). . Can I switch my investment fund choice after availing of ULIP? . Yes, Investors can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies. .",

            "title": "Credit Cards",
            "content": "Introduction . Credit Cards work on the general principle of buy now and pay later. Apart from providing instant credit access, the cards also offer a host of other privileges, including cashback, reward points, discounts, and more. . When used wisely, credit cards can be a powerful financial asset. You can boost your credit score and other benefits by spending less daily. But if you are not financially disciplined, you tend to misuse your credit cards which leaves you in higher financial distress. Here are some common credit mistakes and tips on how to avoid them: . Making Late Payments . Paying your credit card debts late damages your credit score and may negatively impact your credit card issuer. A month’s late payment could reduce your credit card score by 100 points. Imagine you are late for three months or more. You also risk accumulating APR on your delinquent payments, increasing your debt profile. . . Set up autopay to ensure payments are always made on time. And if you don&#39;t prefer autopay, set calendar reminders and email notifications. Only Paying the Minimum Amount Due . Credit card issuers make it convenient to repay your balance by allowing minimum payments. However, paying more than the minimum amount is preferred when you can afford it. . Paying the minimum amount and revolving the credit to the next cycle can damage your finances like any missed or late payment. This is because interest is levied on the unpaid balance. When you pay only the minimum amount, the interest charges will be levied on the remaining balance. Paying the minimum can add more months — even years required to pay off your debt. . . Have a payment plan before you take on any bigger expenses, and always make consistent, on-time payments toward your balance. Not knowing your APR and applicable fees . When you apply and are approved for a credit card, you receive a long cardmember agreement that probably doesn’t top your must-read list. However, you must parse through the jargon and review important account terms to understand all the applicable fees. . Here are some key terms to look out for and what they mean: . Annual Fee: The yearly fee charged for holding a card. | Purchase APR: The annual percentage rate is the yearly interest rate purchases are charged when you carry a balance month-to-month Divide by 12 to get the monthly interest rate. | Late Payment Fee: The amount you are charged over and above the interest on the outstanding amount you owe for missing monthly payments. | Foreign Transaction Fee: Purchases made outside India often incur a fee, typically 2.5% - 3.5% per transaction. | Balance-Transfer Fee: When you transfer debt, you’ll often incur a 3% to 5% fee. | . Not Reviewing Your Account Statement . One common but easily avoidable mistake you can make on your credit card account is to overlook checking your account statement regularly. . Reviewing your credit card account periodically allows you to know the status of your account and prevent reporting or charging errors and potential frauds from taking advantage of your account. . If you cannot keep up with a weekly review, you should do a monthly account review to keep up with your bills and know the status of your account. . Having Too Many Credit Card Accounts . This might be a good idea in the short term because it gives you enough options to source lines of credit to cover your expenses. However, in the long run, what this means is that you will not be able to keep up with the accumulated debt on different credit card accounts. . These accounts will also charge APR, which means more debts. Also, when you apply for a new credit card, the card issuer may enquire about your credit cards, and too many inquiries may spook your existing lenders. . You can take advantage of Pre-qualification forms, which allow you to check if you qualify for a new credit card without damaging your credit score. . Taking Cash Advances . Taking out a cash advance is one of the costliest things you can do with your credit card. It may look like the most convenient way of getting some cash at your disposal, but it is also the most expensive one. . As soon as you withdraw the cash, the interest starts accruing on the amount withdrawn. Also, cash advances on credit cards attract an additional fee. Some banks charge a flat amount, while others charge a percentage of the amount withdrawn. . For example, the cash advance fee on HDFC Regalia is 2.5% of the transaction amount. . Maxing Out your Card . Using the majority, or all, of your available credit, is never a good idea. The amount of credit you use plays into your utilisation rate. The higher the utilisation rate, the lower your credit score. . If you frequently charge close to your monthly limit and have no problem paying off your bill, you can call the credit card company and ask for a credit increase. . . FAQs . What is APR? . The annual percentage rate (APR) refers to the yearly interest you pay on your borrowed amount to your credit card provider. . Who Issues Credit Scores in India? . The Reserve Bank of India has provided authorization to companies that have registered under The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 to provide credit scores or ratings based on the past performances that have been reported by numerous member credit institutions and banks. CIBIL or Credit Information Bureau India Limited is India’s leading credit information bureau. .",

            "title": "Market Basket Analysis",
            "content": "Dataset . The dataset is publicly available from the Kaggle website. It contains the Transactions data from a bakery from 30/10/2016 to 09/04/2017. The data belongs to a bakery called &quot;The Bread Basket&quot; that serves coffee, bread, muffin, cookies and so on. It is located in the historic center of Edinburgh. . Understanding MBA . Market basket analysis (MBA), also known as association-rule mining, is a useful method of discovering customer purchasing patterns by extracting associations or co-occurrences from stores&#39; transactional databases (Chen et al., 2005). It is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. For example, if you are in a supermarket and you buy a loaf of Bread, you are more likely to buy a packet of Butter at the same time than somebody who didn&#39;t buy the Bread. Another example, if you are buying a XiaoMi Power Bank in an online store, you are more likely to also buy a carrying case to go with the power bank. Amazon knows this well from the transaction data of its millions of customers and thus recommends a case to you as seen below: . . The set of items a customer buys is known as an itemset, and MBA tries to identify relationships from the purchases of itemset. The output of MBA consists of a series of product association rules. From the transaction data extracted from the shopping carts of online retailers or the point of sales system of retail stores, we can use MBA to extract interesting association rules between products. For example, if customers buy product A they also tend to buy product B. . Typically we can extract the relationship between products in the form of a rule, an example of association rule: . IF {bread} THEN {butter}. . In this example, if customers buy Bread they also tend to buy Butter. Some people often link products with high association to &quot;complementary goods&quot;. In Economics 101, complementary good or service is consumed or used in conjunction with another good or service. Usually, the complementary good has little to no value when consumed alone, but when combined with another good or service, it adds to the overall value of the offering. For example a car and petrol. It would be of little value to buy petrol without owning a car. Complementary goods often have a negative cross-price elasticity of demand coefficient (Farnham, 2014). However, it is worth pointing out that, while complementary goods tend to have high association, not all products with high association rules are complementary goods. In MBA, we are more interested in product-pairs with high association rules i.e. products that are frequently purchased together. For example, in a retail store, MBA findings may show that Barbie dolls and candy are frequently purchased together, even though they are not technically complementary goods. In short, complementary goods are fairly obvious and common sense, but MBA seeks to uncover product associations that may not be so obvious and straighforward. In doing so, it is attempting to convert the abstract consumer tastes and preferences into association rules that are more insightful and actionable, from business perspective. . . Applications . There are many real-life applications of MBA: . Recommendation engine – showing related products as &quot;Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought&quot; or “Frequently bought together” (as shown in the Amazon example above). It can also be applied to recommend videos and news article by analyzing the videos or news articles that are often watched or read together in a user session. | Cross-sell / bundle products – selling associated products as a &quot;bundle&quot; instead of individual items. For example, transaction data may show that customers often buy a new phone with screen protector together. Phone retailers can then package new phone with high-margin screen protector together and sell them as a bundle, thereby increasing their sales. | Arrangement of items in retail stores – associated items can be placed closer to each other, thereby invoking &quot;impulse buying&quot;. For example it may be uncovered that customers who buy Barbie dolls also buy candy at the same time. Thus retailers can place high-margin candy near Barbie doll display, thereby tempting customers to buy them together. | Detecting fraud – identifying related actions whenever a fraudulent transaction is performed. For example, in a fraudulent insurance claim for stolen vehicle, it may be analyzed (from historical data) that claimant frequently report the incident a few days late (action 1) and often refuse to cooperate with insurer on investigation (action 2). Insurers can identify these red flags once certain behaviours or actions are displayed by the claimants. | . . Case Study . For simplicity we are analyzing only 2 items – Bread and Butter. We want to know if there is any evidence that suggests that buying Bread leads to buying Butter. . Problem Statament: Is the purchase of Bread leads to the purchase of Butter? Hypothesis: There is significant evidence to show that buying Bread leads to buying Butter. . Bread =&gt; Butter . Antecedent =&gt; Consequent . Let&#39;s take the example of a supermarket which generates 1,000 transactions monthly, of which Bread was purchased in 150 transactions, Butter in 130 transactions, and both together in 50 transactions. . In set theory it can be represented as Bread only – 100, Butter only – 80, Bread and Butter – 50, as shown in the Venn diagram below: . . Analysis and Findings . We can use MBA to extract the association rule between Bread and Butter. There are three metrics or criteria to evaluate the strength or quality of an association rule, which are support, confidence and lift. . 1. Support . Support measures the percentage of transactions containing a particular combination of items relative to the total number of transactions. In our example, this is the percentage of transactions where both Bread and Butter are bought together. We need to calculate this to know if this combination of items is significant or negligible? Generally, we want a high percentage i.e. high support in order to make sure it is a useful relationship. Typically, we will set a threshold, for example we will only look at a combination if more than 1% of transactions have this combination. . Support (antecedent (Bread) and consequent (Butter)) = Number of transactions having both items / Total transactions . . Result: The support value of 5% means 5% of all transactions have this combination of Bread and Butter bought together. Since the value is above the threshold of 1%, it shows there is indeed support for this association and thus satisfy the first criteria. . . 2. Confidence . Confidence measures the probability of finding a particular combination of items whenever antecedent is bought. In probability terms, confidence is the conditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent and is represented as P (consequent / antecedent). In our example, it is the probability of both Bread and Butter being bought together whenever Bread is bought. Typically, we may set a threshold, say we want this combination to occur at least 25% of times when Bread is bought. . Confidence (antecedent i.e. Bread and consequent i.e. Butter) = P (Consequent (Butter) is bought GIVEN antecedent (Bread) is bought) . . Result: The confidence value of 33.3% is above the threshold of 25%, indicating we can be confident that Butter will be bought whenever Bread is bought, and thus satisfy the second criteria. . . 3. Lift . Lift is a metric to determine how much the purchase of antecedent influences the purchase of consequent. In our example, we want to know whether the purchase of Butter is independent of the purchase of Bread (or) is the purchase of Butter happening due to the purchase of Bread? In probability terms, we want to know which is higher, P (Butter) or P (Butter / Bread)? If the purchase of Butter is influenced by the purchase of Bread, then P (Butter / Bread) will be higher than P (Butter), or in other words, the ratio of P (Butter / Bread) over P (Butter) will be higher than 1. . . Result: The lift value of 2.56 is greater than 1, it shows that the purchase of Butter is indeed influenced by the purchase of Bread rather than Butter&#39;s purchase being independent of Bread. The lift value of 2.56 also means that Bread&#39;s purchase lifts the Butter&#39;s purchase by 2.56 times. . . Conclusion . Based on the findings above, we can justify our initial hypothesis as we . a) Have the support of 5% transactions for Bread and Butter in the same basket b) Have 33.3% confidence that Butter sales happen whenever Bread is purchased. c) Knows the lift in Butter&#39;s sales is 2.56 times more, whenever Bread is purchased than when Butter is purchased alone. . Therefore, we can conclude that there is indeed evidence to suggest that the purchase of Bread leads to the purchase of Butter. This is a valuable insight to guide management&#39;s decision-making. For example, managers of retail stores could start placing bread and butter close to each other, knowing that customers are highly likely to &quot;impulsively&quot; purchase them together, thereby increasing the store&#39;s revenue. .

Note: Saturday is the busiest day of the week with the highest sales (~200 items) while Wednesday is the quietest day with the lowest sales (~101 items). This is an interesting insight, the owner of the Bakery should launch some promotion activities to boost up sales in the middle of the week when sales are slowest. . The Apriori function in the MLxtend library expects data in a one-hot encoded pandas DataFrame. This means that all the data for a transaction must be included in one row and the items must be one-hot encoded. Example below: . Coffee Cake Bread Cookie Muffin Tea Milk Juice Sandwich . 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | . 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | . 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | . 4 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . Therefore, we&#39;ll need to group the bread dataframe by Transaction and Item and display the count of items. Then we need to consolidate the items into one transaction per row with each item one-hot encoded. . df = bread.groupby([&quot;Transaction&quot;,&quot;Item&quot;]).size().reset_index(name=&quot;Count&quot;) df.head() . Transaction Item Count . 0 1 | Bread | 1 | . 1 2 | Scandinavian | 2 | . 2 3 | Cookies | 1 | . 3 3 | Hot chocolate | 1 | . 4 3 | Jam | 1 | . basket = (df.groupby([&#39;Transaction&#39;, &#39;Item&#39;])[&#39;Count&#39;] .sum().unstack().reset_index().fillna(0) .set_index(&#39;Transaction&#39;)) basket.head() .

Important: At this stage, the one-hot encoded table shows the count of items purchased as result.

Note: After applying the encoding function, for the same Transaction 6887, the cell value for Coffee has become &quot;1&quot; which is what we need for the Apriori function. .

Generate Association Rules . The final step is to generate the rules with their corresponding support, confidence and lift.

Interpretation and Implications . The output above shows the Top 10 itemsets sorted by confidence value and all itemsets have support value over 1% and lift value over 1. The first itemset shows the association rule &quot;if Toast then Coffee&quot; with support value at 0.023666 means nearly 2.4% of all transactions have this combination of Toast and Coffee bought together. We also have 70% confidence that Coffee sales happen whenever a Toast is purchased. The lift value of 1.47 (greater than 1) shows that the purchase of Coffee is indeed influenced by the purchase of Toast rather than Coffee&#39;s purchase being independent of Toast. The lift value of 1.47 means that Toast&#39;s purchase lifts the Coffee&#39;s purchase by 1.47 times. . Therefore, we can conclude that there is indeed evidence to suggest that the purchase of Toast leads to the purchase of Coffee. The owner of the bakery &quot;The Bread Basket&quot; should consider bundling Toast and Cofee together as a Breakfast Set or Lunch Set, the staff in the store should also be trained to cross-sell Coffee to customers who purchase Toast, knowing that they are more likely to purchase them together, thereby increasing the store&#39;s revenue. .

            "content": "Introduction . We have heard multiple strategies to make money in the stock markets. One lesser-known investing strategy is factor investing. Factor investing is an investment approach that targets specific return drivers across asset classes. . What are the factors? . Factors are the foundation of investing. They are broad, persistent drivers of returns across asset classes. Factors work to better capture the potential for excess returns and reduced risks. There are broadly two types of factors that have driven returns - macroeconomic factors, which capture broad risks across asset classes, and style factors, which help explain returns and risk within asset classes. . What is Factor Investing? . Factor investing is designed to enhance diversification, generate above-market returns and manage risk. Portfolio diversification has long been a popular safety tactic, but diversification gains are lost if the chosen securities move in lockstep with the broader market. For example, an investor may select a mixture of stocks and bonds that all decline in value when certain market conditions arise. The good news is factor investing can offset potential risks by targeting broad, persistent, and long-recognized drivers of returns. . Macroeconomic Factors . Economic Growth: The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country, how well is the country poised to grow, what are the drivers of this growth, etc.? | Real rates: The risks and opportunities presented by the changes in interest rates, their effect on bond yields, and how one can maximise returns and reduce risks by dynamic allocation in interest rate-dependent asset classes. | Credit: How a business manages its credit, default probability, and ability to repay the debt on time play an important role while choosing asset classes. | Emerging Markets: Government stability and resource dependency are essential in making investment decisions. | . Style factors . Value: It aims to capture excess returns from stocks with low prices relative to their fundamental value. This is commonly tracked by price to book, price to earnings, dividends, and free cash flow. | Size: Historically, portfolios consisting of small-cap stocks exhibit greater returns than portfolios with just large-cap stocks. Investors can capture size by looking at the market capitalization of a stock. | Momentum: Stocks that have outperformed in the past tend to exhibit strong returns going forward. A momentum strategy is grounded in relative returns from three months to one year. | Quality: It is defined by low debt, stable earnings, consistent asset growth, and strong corporate governance. Investors can identify quality stocks using standard financial metrics like a return to equity, debt to equity, and earnings variability. | Volatility: Empirical research suggests that stocks with low volatility earn greater risk-adjusted returns than highly volatile assets. Measuring standard deviation from a one- to three-year time frame is a standard method of capturing beta. | . Pros of factor Investing . Tried and tested: The biggest pro of factor investing is that it has worked in the long term. Focusing on one factor at a time can help simplify the analysis process for investors who might otherwise get overwhelmed by thousands of fundamental and technical analysis metrics for each stock. | Diversified approach: Finally, different factors can have a relatively low correlation, allowing investors to potentially reduce their portfolios’ overall risk and volatility by diversifying based on several factors. | . Cons of factor Investing . Longer-term approach: Factor investing is a long-term strategy; investors shouldn’t necessarily expect outperformance over months or even years. In fact, it can take several years to even test a potential factor as a viable investment strategy. Just because a factor has worked in the past doesn’t mean it will continue to work in the future. | Potential bias: Factor investors can also be prone to selection bias. If you back-test enough factors for outperformance, you will eventually find factors that have generated positive historical results simply by chance. | Unknown risks: Finally, correlations among different factors change over time, potentially creating more risk in a multifactor portfolio than investors realize. | . Bottom-Line . It’s essential to remember that the factors are expected to outperform the broad market primarily over the long term. Each of these factors has extended periods in its history where it underperforms the general market or has significant drawdowns. One way managers try to get around this is by diversifying among the factors and using macroeconomic factors to construct their portfolios. This approach is called smart beta investing. . . FAQs . What is smart beta investing? . Smart beta investment portfolios are long-only rules-based investment strategies that aim to outperform a capitalization-weighted benchmark. . Is factor investing active or passive? . It is an investment strategy that combines active with passive styles of investing in order to capture excess returns at reduced risk. . How long should one be invested in factor investing portfolios? . An ideal timeline is long-term. This could be anytime from 5 years to a decade. .",

            "content": "Background . Time spent thinking about doing something takes away the time you have to actually do it. . Having read the above words of advice on my Instagram feed, I decided to research interesting things to do when you have a lot of time to spend. I somewhat had an idea that I wanted to do something related to computers, maybe read about some new technology or try learning a new programming language. While browsing the internet, I came across an interesting YouTube video title “Python Project Create Real Software”. . I have been using python for scientific computing on Google Collaboratory for my university courses but have never had the opportunity to use this powerful language to create something. So keeping in mind the above quote, I jumped right into ‘creating’ this project. . I am writing this blog as an experience of mine and not a review per se. I appreciate the content creator for his efforts and give him full credit for the coding aspect of the project. . Pre-requisites: . Basic Knowledge of Python: Basic data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. Some knowledge of tkinter - Graphical User Interface (GUI) package that is bundled with Python, Some experience with object oriented programming is beneficial but not necessary . | A very versatile text editor (ironic that one needs one to build one :D) like Visual Studio Code (VSC), Atom, Sublime or any editor of your choice. I personally prefer VSC since it has myriad extensions to make your life easy . | Willingness to learn something new, there are instances where it gets a bit repetitive while defining functionality for various features in the editor and one may feel the need to simply copy-paste those sections from the source code but do remember that doing so does hamper one’s learning . | . Features of the Text Editor: . A toolbar which houses the Bold, italic, alignment options and other basic text editing features . | A status bar for counting words and characters . | The new file, open, save, save-as, exit functionalities common to most applications. . | Multiple colour themes . | . Experience . I decided to name my text editor Brief , a name shared by a once-popular programmer’s text editor in the 1980s and early 1990s. . The prerequisite knowledge helped me in grasping the concepts explained in the video quite easily. The content delivered was simple and to the point with little to no shift from the main goal of the tutorial i.e. coding a text editor. In my personal opinion, a Python novice too can easily build this software with a bit of extra effort. . The great thing about this tutorial is that towards the end, the creator walks you through the process of taking the python script and converting it into a executable (.exe), which can be placed on your desktop and may replace a basic text editor. I would personally recommend using pyinstaller package rather than the cx_freeze package to make an executable. Pyinstaller is easier to use and does not requires a lot of effort. Just remember to use the correct flags to generate your desired outputs. . A few screenshots of the editor: . First screen . Dark Theme . . Scope for improvement . The bold, italic and underline buttons can have their functionality improved by incorporating selective highlighting. . | Functionality to add tables and charts in the editor. . | Functionality to export the .txt files to other extensions. . | . I thoroughly enjoyed coding the program and would be actively looking to code similar programs in the near future. I will share my experiences via this blog. . Resources . - Source Code . - Youtube Video . - Pyinstaller Package . - VSC Download . - My GitHub .",

            "content": "Introduction . Mutual funds have been here for a long time now. Each fund is a particular category, like flexicap, multi-cap, large-cap, arbitrage, etc. One such fund category that is relatively new is the Quant Fund category. Quant funds have been here for less than a decade but have sure beaten decade-old mutual funds in terms of return on investments! . What are quant funds? . Quant funds are a special kind of mutual fund whose asset allocation, including stock picking, is decided based on a predefined set of rules. They are built with customised models using software programs to determine investments. These funds are part active and part passive and are taxed according to equity funds. Choosing investments using inputs and computer programs helps fund companies reduce the risks and losses associated with management by human fund managers. . How does a quant fund work? . Quant funds rely on algorithmic or systematically programmed investment strategies. They use quantitative rather than fundamental analysis, which is why they’re also called quantitative funds. These algorithms are often proprietary and a heavily guarded secret for certain fund houses. One such example is ‘Quant Mutual Fund.’ The funds offered by this fund house have repeatedly created a more significant alpha and beaten the broader markets consistently. . Greater access to a broader range of market data fueled the growth of quant funds, not to mention the growing number of solutions surrounding the use of big data. Developments in financial technology and increasing innovation around automation have vastly broadened the data sets quant fund managers can work with, giving them even more robust data feeds for a broader analysis of scenarios and time horizons. . qAdvantages of quant funds . They limit human intervention and maintain a neutral investing attitude | Lower chances of error than traditional investing | Lower management fees due to reduced human intervention | Better risk-adjusted returns since calculations are on point and evolve with the dynamic conditions of the market | . Disadvantages of quant funds . Require continuous testing to validate forecasts | Some models may fail to account for black swan events | Models assume too many assumptions, which may result in different risk-adjusted returns | . Conclusion . If you think of quant funds as a straightforward manner to earn high returns, then you may be disappointed as they don’t assure returns. Most models are based on historical data with little to no guarantee of future returns. Quant funds can fail as they are primarily based on historical events, and the past doesn’t always repeat itself in the future. However, these funds ensure that the fund managers never deviate from the investment mandate. . . FAQs . How do you invest in Quant Funds? . Quant funds can be bought from the fund house like any other regular fund. there is no special application for the same. . Which AMCs offer Quant Funds? . Quant Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund, and DSP Mutual Fund all have quant funds as an offering to the potential investors . Can Quant Funds beat other funds? . Quant funds are known to beat other funds by a large margin, but this is due to the fact that these funds have a high churn ratio. A higher churn ratio often leads to larger fees due to repeated buying and selling. These charges may sometimes eat up your alpha. .",

            "content": "Ever wondered what’s a guaranteed path to get rich? What looks like a straight path is a simple two-step process - saving and investing. Saving is the easier of the two steps, but when it comes to investing, one, people have apprehensions, and two, there is risk involved. Mutual Funds are an excellent way to tackle this risk and grow wealth over time. . This blog aims to inform you about the various types of mutual funds categorized on the following grounds: . Structure | Asset Class | Investment Goals | Risk Appetite | Specialised Funds | . Based on Structure . Open-Ended Funds: These funds do not limit when or how many units can be purchased. Investors can enter or exit at the current net asset value (NAV) throughout the year. These funds are ideal for investors seeking liquidity. E.g., All funds that are not listed on the exchanges. | Close-Ended Funds: The unit capital to invest is pre-defined in closed-ended funds. The fund company cannot sell more than the pre-agreed number of units. To facilitate liquidity, these funds trade on stock exchanges. E.g., Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) | Interval Funds: These are a mixture of both open-ended and close-ended schemes. These funds are open for purchase or redemption only during specific intervals (decided by the fund houses) and are closed the rest of the time. They also have a lock-in period of two years after the initial purchase. These funds are predominantly debt-oriented. E.g. IDFC Yearly Series Interval Fund. | Based on Asset Class . Equity Funds: Equity funds primarily invest in stocks. They invest the money pooled from various investors from diverse backgrounds into shares/supplies of different companies. The gains and losses associated with these funds depend solely on how the invested shares perform in the stock market. E.g.: Axis Bluechip Fund | Debt Funds: They invest in various fixed income instruments such as Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), Gilt Funds, Liquid Funds, Short-Term Plans, Long-Term Bonds and Monthly Income Plans, among others. Great for investors looking for passive income over fixed durations. E.g.: Aditya Birla Sun Life Liquid Fund | Hybrid Funds: As the name suggests, Hybrid or Balanced Funds are an optimum mix of bonds and stocks, thereby bridging the gap between equity funds and debt funds. The ratio can either be variable or fixed. E.g.: Kotak Equity Hybrid Fund | Based on Investment Goals . Growth Funds: Funds that invest primarily in high-performing stocks with the aim of capital appreciation are considered growth funds. These funds can be an attractive option for investors seeking high returns over a long period. E.g., Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund | Tax Saving Funds: Equity-linked saving schemes are mutual funds that invest primarily in company securities. However, they qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They have a minimum investment horizon of three years. E.g., L&amp;T Tax Advantage Fund | Capital Protection Funds: These funds invest partially in fixed income instruments and into equities. This could ensure capital protection, i.e., minimal loss, if any. However, returns are taxable. E.g., SBI CPO Fund | Based on Risk Appetite . Very Low-Risk Funds: Liquid and ultra-short duration funds are considered very-low risk funds. Their returns are low (6% at best). Investors usually park their surplus cash in such funds until they find better investment opportunities. E.g.: Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund | Low-risk Funds: Arbitrage funds are considered low-risk funds. They have minimal exposure to equities and high-risk asset classes. These are best suited for risk-averse investors, and again the returns are 6-8% on average. Eg: Tata Arbitrage Fund | Medium-Risk Funds: Such funds have considerable exposure to equities. These funds are very similar to index funds and give moderate returns in the range of 9-12% E.g., Kotak Savings Funds | High-Risk Funds: These funds have maximum stock exposure (&gt;95%). The NAV for these funds is volatile too. Moreover, these funds are best suited for young people who have a higher risk appetite. Returns are upwards of 15%, often beating the indexes they track. Some funds also give returns of above 20% E.g., Quant small-cap funds | Specialised Funds . Sector Funds: Sector funds invest solely in a specific sector. They are theme-based funds. If investors want to leverage sectoral trends, they can invest via this route. E.g., BOI AXA Manufacturing &amp; Infrastructure Fund | Index Funds: These are passive funds with very low expense ratios. They track an index and invest according to the constituents of the same. They are great for investors seeking moderate returns. They may or may not beat the index. E.g., UTI Nifty Index Fund | Fund of Funds: These are special mutual funds that invest in units of other mutual funds. Most global funds available in India are of this type. In short, you are buying a fund that invests in additional diverse funds. E.g., ICICI Prudential Asset Allocator Fund (FoF) | International Funds: These funds invest in companies outside India.

What are regular and direct options in mutual funds? . When one invests via a mutual fund distributor, one invests in regular funds. Regular funds tend to have a higher expense ratio to compensate for the commission paid by the AMC to the distributor. On the other hand, direct plans have a lower expense ratio as there is no intermediary; you engage directly with the fund house. If you invest via your financial advisor, a regular plan suits you; otherwise, a direct plan is much better to reduce expenses. . Are returns guaranteed in mutual funds? . Most AMC has a disclosure that the fund may fail to achieve its goals, and hence one should perform proper due diligence before investing. . What is the IDCW option in funds? . IDCW stands for Income Distribution cum Withdrawal. These are plans where the AMC periodically distributes profit to its unitholders via the declaration of annual dividends. These are suitable for people looking for a regular income stream from their investments. .",

Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
