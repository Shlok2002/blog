            "title": "What is an NFT?",
            "content": "Jack Dorsey sells his first tweet ever as an NFT for $2.9 million, read the headline of major business newspapers on 24th March 2021. A year later, Twitter is going private, all thanks to Elon Musk, in what is said to be the largest Leveraged buyout (LBO) ever. Both Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk are successful entrepreneurs who have voiced their support for the Blockchain Revolution. This revolution is not going away anytime soon! Let’s get back to the question, can you sell a tweet? How do you do it, and what is that N-F-T doing there in the headline? . What is an NFT? . NFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token; non-fungible means something that cannot be exchanged for an item because it is unique. In other words, you can exchange a ₹100 note for another ₹100 note as both have the same value associated with them. Another classic example is a cryptocurrency; 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another. Cryptocurrency is fungible, whereas NFTs are not. On the other hand, one piece of artwork is not equal to another; The Mona Lisa is not equal to a Van Gogh’s since both have unique properties. NFTs are tokens that live on a blockchain and represent ownership of unique items. Why do you need a blockchain to do this? Well, tracking a digital file is tricky, as it can be copied and distributed effortlessly. A blockchain comes in handy for ease of tracking ownership and for the value discovery of an asset. Let us take an example to cement our understanding. . Suppose you made a piece of digital art. You can create a .jpg or mint an NFT out of this. The NFT that represents your art contains information about it, such as . A unique fingerprint ID of the file (Hash) . | Token Name . | Token Symbol . | . This token is then stored on the blockchain, and you, the artist, become the owner. To sell the artwork, you create a transaction on the blockchain, and the blockchain makes sure that this information can never be tampered with. It also allows you to track the current owner if the artwork is traded further. In other words, it is a smart contract on the blockchain that stores the unique properties of the asset and keeps track of current and previous owners. . Specifics of an NFT . It is important to note that the artwork itself is not stored in the blockchain; only its attributes like hash, name and a link to the actual artwork are stored in the block. Also, one must keep in mind that you often do not get a physical copy of the original artwork and most of the time, anyone can download a physical copy for free. The NFT only represents proof of ownership. It gives you exclusive ‘digital bragging rights. . NFTs are not limited to pieces of digital artwork, though a bulk of the market comprises these; NFTs can also include concert tickets, domain names, in-game limited edition items, real estate and anything that is unique and requires proof of ownership. The prices of NFTs are not uniform and depend on supply-demand characteristics. A word of caution: an expensive NFT becomes worthless if no one wants to buy it! . . FAQs . Where can one buy NFTs? . NFTs can be bought online on open-source exchanges and NFT marketplaces. . Which blockchain is used in NFTs? . A bulk of contracts are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. .",

            "title": "Credit Cards",
            "content": "Introduction . Credit Cards work on the general principle of buy now and pay later. Apart from providing instant credit access, the cards also offer a host of other privileges, including cashback, reward points, discounts, and more. . When used wisely, credit cards can be a powerful financial asset. You can boost your credit score and other benefits by spending less daily. But if you are not financially disciplined, you tend to misuse your credit cards which leaves you in higher financial distress. Here are some common credit mistakes and tips on how to avoid them: . Making Late Payments . Paying your credit card debts late damages your credit score and may negatively impact your credit card issuer. A month’s late payment could reduce your credit card score by 100 points. Imagine you are late for three months or more. You also risk accumulating APR on your delinquent payments, increasing your debt profile. . . Set up autopay to ensure payments are always made on time. And if you don&#39;t prefer autopay, set calendar reminders and email notifications. Only Paying the Minimum Amount Due . Credit card issuers make it convenient to repay your balance by allowing minimum payments. However, paying more than the minimum amount is preferred when you can afford it. . Paying the minimum amount and revolving the credit to the next cycle can damage your finances like any missed or late payment. This is because interest is levied on the unpaid balance. When you pay only the minimum amount, the interest charges will be levied on the remaining balance. Paying the minimum can add more months — even years required to pay off your debt. . . Have a payment plan before you take on any bigger expenses, and always make consistent, on-time payments toward your balance. Not knowing your APR and applicable fees . When you apply and are approved for a credit card, you receive a long cardmember agreement that probably doesn’t top your must-read list. However, you must parse through the jargon and review important account terms to understand all the applicable fees. . Here are some key terms to look out for and what they mean: . Annual Fee: The yearly fee charged for holding a card. | Purchase APR: The annual percentage rate is the yearly interest rate purchases are charged when you carry a balance month-to-month Divide by 12 to get the monthly interest rate. | Late Payment Fee: The amount you are charged over and above the interest on the outstanding amount you owe for missing monthly payments. | Foreign Transaction Fee: Purchases made outside India often incur a fee, typically 2.5% - 3.5% per transaction. | Balance-Transfer Fee: When you transfer debt, you’ll often incur a 3% to 5% fee. | . Not Reviewing Your Account Statement . One common but easily avoidable mistake you can make on your credit card account is to overlook checking your account statement regularly. . Reviewing your credit card account periodically allows you to know the status of your account and prevent reporting or charging errors and potential frauds from taking advantage of your account. . If you cannot keep up with a weekly review, you should do a monthly account review to keep up with your bills and know the status of your account. . Having Too Many Credit Card Accounts . This might be a good idea in the short term because it gives you enough options to source lines of credit to cover your expenses. However, in the long run, what this means is that you will not be able to keep up with the accumulated debt on different credit card accounts. . These accounts will also charge APR, which means more debts. Also, when you apply for a new credit card, the card issuer may enquire about your credit cards, and too many inquiries may spook your existing lenders. . You can take advantage of Pre-qualification forms, which allow you to check if you qualify for a new credit card without damaging your credit score. . Taking Cash Advances . Taking out a cash advance is one of the costliest things you can do with your credit card. It may look like the most convenient way of getting some cash at your disposal, but it is also the most expensive one. . As soon as you withdraw the cash, the interest starts accruing on the amount withdrawn. Also, cash advances on credit cards attract an additional fee. Some banks charge a flat amount, while others charge a percentage of the amount withdrawn. . . For example, the cash advance fee on HDFC Regalia is 2.5% of the transaction amount. Maxing Out your Card . Using the majority, or all, of your available credit, is never a good idea. The amount of credit you use plays into your utilisation rate. The higher the utilisation rate, the lower your credit score. . If you frequently charge close to your monthly limit and have no problem paying off your bill, you can call the credit card company and ask for a credit increase. . . FAQs . What is APR? . The annual percentage rate (APR) refers to the yearly interest you pay on your borrowed amount to your credit card provider. . Who Issues Credit Scores in India? . The Reserve Bank of India has provided authorization to companies that have registered under The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 to provide credit scores or ratings based on the past performances that have been reported by numerous member credit institutions and banks. CIBIL or Credit Information Bureau India Limited is India’s leading credit information bureau. .",

            "content": "- toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Shlok Kamat - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . . Case Study . For simplicity we are analyzing only 2 items – Bread and Butter. We want to know if there is any evidence that suggests that buying Bread leads to buying Butter. . Problem Statament: Is the purchase of Bread leads to the purchase of Butter? Hypothesis: There is significant evidence to show that buying Bread leads to buying Butter. . Bread =&gt; Butter . Antecedent =&gt; Consequent . Let&#39;s take the example of a supermarket which generates 1,000 transactions monthly, of which Bread was purchased in 150 transactions, Butter in 130 transactions, and both together in 50 transactions. . In set theory it can be represented as Bread only – 100, Butter only – 80, Bread and Butter – 50, as shown in the Venn diagram below: . . Analysis and Findings . We can use MBA to extract the association rule between Bread and Butter. There are three metrics or criteria to evaluate the strength or quality of an association rule, which are support, confidence and lift. . 1. Support . Support measures the percentage of transactions containing a particular combination of items relative to the total number of transactions. In our example, this is the percentage of transactions where both Bread and Butter are bought together. We need to calculate this to know if this combination of items is significant or negligible? Generally, we want a high percentage i.e. high support in order to make sure it is a useful relationship. Typically, we will set a threshold, for example we will only look at a combination if more than 1% of transactions have this combination. . Support (antecedent (Bread) and consequent (Butter)) = Number of transactions having both items / Total transactions . . Result: The support value of 5% means 5% of all transactions have this combination of Bread and Butter bought together. Since the value is above the threshold of 1%, it shows there is indeed support for this association and thus satisfy the first criteria. . . 2. Confidence . Confidence measures the probability of finding a particular combination of items whenever antecedent is bought. In probability terms, confidence is the conditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent and is represented as P (consequent / antecedent). In our example, it is the probability of both Bread and Butter being bought together whenever Bread is bought. Typically, we may set a threshold, say we want this combination to occur at least 25% of times when Bread is bought. . Confidence (antecedent i.e. Bread and consequent i.e. Butter) = P (Consequent (Butter) is bought GIVEN antecedent (Bread) is bought) . . Result: The confidence value of 33.3% is above the threshold of 25%, indicating we can be confident that Butter will be bought whenever Bread is bought, and thus satisfy the second criteria. . . 3. Lift . Lift is a metric to determine how much the purchase of antecedent influences the purchase of consequent. In our example, we want to know whether the purchase of Butter is independent of the purchase of Bread (or) is the purchase of Butter happening due to the purchase of Bread? In probability terms, we want to know which is higher, P (Butter) or P (Butter / Bread)? If the purchase of Butter is influenced by the purchase of Bread, then P (Butter / Bread) will be higher than P (Butter), or in other words, the ratio of P (Butter / Bread) over P (Butter) will be higher than 1. . . Result: The lift value of 2.56 is greater than 1, it shows that the purchase of Butter is indeed influenced by the purchase of Bread rather than Butter&#39;s purchase being independent of Bread. The lift value of 2.56 also means that Bread&#39;s purchase lifts the Butter&#39;s purchase by 2.56 times. . . Conclusion . Based on the findings above, we can justify our initial hypothesis as we . a) Have the support of 5% transactions for Bread and Butter in the same basket b) Have 33.3% confidence that Butter sales happen whenever Bread is purchased. c) Knows the lift in Butter&#39;s sales is 2.56 times more, whenever Bread is purchased than when Butter is purchased alone. . Therefore, we can conclude that there is indeed evidence to suggest that the purchase of Bread leads to the purchase of Butter. This is a valuable insight to guide management&#39;s decision-making. For example, managers of retail stores could start placing bread and butter close to each other, knowing that customers are highly likely to &quot;impulsively&quot; purchase them together, thereby increasing the store&#39;s revenue. .

            "content": "Background . Time spent thinking about doing something takes away the time you have to actually do it. . Having read the above words of advice on my Instagram feed, I decided to research interesting things to do when you have a lot of time to spend. I somewhat had an idea that I wanted to do something related to computers, maybe read about some new technology or try learning a new programming language. While browsing the internet, I came across an interesting YouTube video title “Python Project Create Real Software”. . I have been using python for scientific computing on Google Collaboratory for my university courses but have never had the opportunity to use this powerful language to create something. So keeping in mind the above quote, I jumped right into ‘creating’ this project. . I am writing this blog as an experience of mine and not a review per se. I appreciate the content creator for his efforts and give him full credit for the coding aspect of the project. . Pre-requisites: . Basic Knowledge of Python: Basic data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. Some knowledge of tkinter - Graphical User Interface (GUI) package that is bundled with Python, Some experience with object oriented programming is beneficial but not necessary . | A very versatile text editor (ironic that one needs one to build one :D) like Visual Studio Code (VSC), Atom, Sublime or any editor of your choice. I personally prefer VSC since it has myriad extensions to make your life easy . | Willingness to learn something new, there are instances where it gets a bit repetitive while defining functionality for various features in the editor and one may feel the need to simply copy-paste those sections from the source code but do remember that doing so does hamper one’s learning . | . Features of the Text Editor: . A toolbar which houses the Bold, italic, alignment options and other basic text editing features . | A status bar for counting words and characters . | The new file, open, save, save-as, exit functionalities common to most applications. . | Multiple colour themes . | . Experience . I decided to name my text editor Brief , a name shared by a once-popular programmer’s text editor in the 1980s and early 1990s. . The prerequisite knowledge helped me in grasping the concepts explained in the video quite easily. The content delivered was simple and to the point with little to no shift from the main goal of the tutorial i.e. coding a text editor. In my personal opinion, a Python novice too can easily build this software with a bit of extra effort. . The great thing about this tutorial is that towards the end, the creator walks you through the process of taking the python script and converting it into a executable (.exe), which can be placed on your desktop and may replace a basic text editor. I would personally recommend using pyinstaller package rather than the cx_freeze package to make an executable. Pyinstaller is easier to use and does not requires a lot of effort. Just remember to use the correct flags to generate your desired outputs. . A few screenshots of the editor: . First screen . Dark Theme . . Scope for improvement . The bold, italic and underline buttons can have their functionality improved by incorporating selective highlighting. . | Functionality to add tables and charts in the editor. . | Functionality to export the .txt files to other extensions. . | . I thoroughly enjoyed coding the program and would be actively looking to code similar programs in the near future. I will share my experiences via this blog. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
