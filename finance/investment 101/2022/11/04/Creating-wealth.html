<p>When are you buying that dream home of yours? When is it that you plan on taking your family for a vacation? To successfully do either of these, one requires money; this ultimately comes from your wealth creation. Wealth? What, How, and Where are the questions we answer here today.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wealth-creation">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-wealth-creation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is wealth creation?</h2>

<p>zWealth creation is investing in different asset classes where the investments will help fulfil critical needs. These investments should also be self-contained,  stable, income-generating, and help one achieve their aspirations.</p>

<p>The wealth creation process will be most effective if started early. Starting investments during the early stages of life will give a head start on achieving goals. It also helps in generating higher growth in the long term. This is due to the power of compounding. The power of compounding is a concept that will help build a considerable future corpus. The idea of compounding revolves around reinvesting the returns into the fund to earn higher growth. Therefore, the longer one stays invested, the higher the wealth gain.</p>
